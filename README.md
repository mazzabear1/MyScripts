# MyScripts

Each folder is a different tool that I'm working on as pet projects.  If you see any issues or ways I could improve my code, feel free to let me know!

## builder
  * Multiple choice test builder, based on the **.txt** files in the same directory written in the `Question | Correct | Wrong | Wrong | Wrong` *as few as 2 and as many as 6, as it's written*
  * Intended to have a key generator, eventually. For now, the keys will have to be made by hand :(
  * The **Test.txt** is currently generated in the directory that **builder.rb** is executed in
  * My tests is custom for my own purposes
