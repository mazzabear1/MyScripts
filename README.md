# MyScripts

Each folder is a different tool that I'm working on as pet projects.  If you see any issues or ways I could improve my code, feel free to let me know!

## builder
  * Multiple choice test builder, based on the **.txt** files in the same directory
  * Intended to have a key generator, eventually. For now, the keys will have to be made by hand :(
  * The **Test.txt** is currently generated in the directory that **builder.rb** is executed in
