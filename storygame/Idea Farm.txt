The Story:
  Players will assume the role the lone survivor of a major earthquake in NY City.
  The game will consist of a series of "days" where the players will be forced to
  select reactions to a variety of scenarios both good and bad.  These scenarios
  will add to - or take away from - their resources (water, food, and sanity).

The Goal:
  The  character learns of the continental impact of the earthquake.  Eventually,
  the player will learn of two camps of survivors and will have to decide between
  Denver, Colorado and Portland, Maine.
