This document outlines the fundamentals of a project I will be working on.  Once
the project is released, I will be posting my code and the developer platform name
here so there's no reason to reinvent the wheel! kthanks.

The Story:
  Players will assume the role the lone survivor of a major earthquake in NY City.
  The game will consist of a series of "days" where the players will be forced to
  select reactions to a variety of scenarios both good and bad.  These scenarios
  will add to - or take away from - their resources (water, food, and sanity).

The Goal:
  The  character learns of the continental impact of the earthquake.  Eventually,
  the player will learn of two camps of survivors and will have to decide between
  Denver, Colorado and Portland, Maine.  If the hero of our story would run out of
  water, food, or would go insane, the player would lose the game.

The Resources:
  Food and Water:
    Food - 100%
    Water - 100%
    For these resources, random events and the player's progression along a preset
    map will enable them to refresh their store of these supplies.  Both Food and Water
    will decrement by a preset percentage every in-game day.
  Sanity:
    Sanity - 100%
    A player's sanity will decrease or increase based on the decisions they make during
    the game.  Events that detract from a player's Sanity will usually benefit their
    other resources.  Events that benefit a player's Sanity will usually detract from
    their other resources.
